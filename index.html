                    <p>Erin is a couple years out of college and trying to figure out where she's being called to work. For now, outside of working as a house painter, her hobbies include nature photography, drawing, woodworking, and writing music. She can be found in Midcoast Maine, hiking local trails with her trusty camera gifted by a friend, looking for birds and other critters and various picturesque scenery in this beautiful part of the amazing world that we live in.</p>
